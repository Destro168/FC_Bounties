Version 3.1:

- Updated for new coloring and money scheming in FC_Suite_Shared. (May have missed numbers, feel free to tell me in comments!)
- Removed success message when creating bounties.
- Updated several strings.
- Added nullpointerexception try/catch to untargetable perm check in SB generation to get rid of a ****ton of annoying errors on reloads.
- Killing people with eggs can now collect bounties.

Version 3.02:

- Fixed minor error with missing space on bounty list.
- Fixed players being able to create bounties worth infinity. (WOOPS)

Version 3.01:

- Built CB release - Build #2377 - CB 1.3.2-R2.0
- Fixed minor coloring error on bounty creation.

Version 3.0:

This version upgrade to 3.0 features a few good changes that should really help bring things in line. Sorry that the installation isn't automatic, you will have to do a few things. As always I recommend backing up your features in case anything goes wrong so that you can report the issue to me and if needed I can fix it.

- All support for previous versions is completely being dropped. That means that if you have a version pre-2.31, then you will need to run 2.31, and then follow the upcoming steps in order to successfully run 3.0. Or you can start from scratch at 3.0, your call. The main things I did was remove the player file transfering code due to it's clunkiness. As well, I removed the code that would upgrade things to past versions, check past sources if interested. Plugin configs will update to 2.31 but player file data won't.

- FC_Suite_Shared now has it's own changelog that can be viewed. It's kind of pointless for me to describe major changes to all plugins 3 times so I will just link it all there, way more organized :)

- I seperated out the userinfo file, the information for that can be viewed in the FC_Shared_Suite changelog. Bounties are now also stored in a new file located at ~/plugins/Fc_bounties/bounties.yml. Please move your bounties from the config file into that file as well. Or, alternatively load up 3.0, create a bounty and the file will appear, and then copy your bounties into the new 

Alright so that wraps up all the installation information for this version, if you do all of that properly then congratulations! Now everything is seperated out in a way that should "never" need changed again. I don't want to be all like "I stole what Essentials did" but my format is pretty similar and since Essentials is pretty boss at the way they have their stuff organized, I can't see myself needing to reorganize again. Sorry for the work!

- Randomly generated server bounties will now show the target of the player bounty if the server bounty target name configuration option is enabled.
- Adjusted wording for broadcasts and fixed capitalization. Announcements have caps on the first letter of words now.
- Added 3 new configuration options for stealing and losing money on death. As well, there is a new money logging option, check configuration setup page for information.
- It is possible now to have both a flat, AND percent amount for bounties that will be rewarded on kills/survivals.
- I guess bonus percent wasn't coded, my bad on that. Had wrong name, nobody reported though but found in code, it's fixed now.
- Just recoded pretty much all of the bounty killing and rewarding stuff for more optimization.
- Players can no longer put bounties on themselves.
- Removed the all keyword for /bounty list. It was clunky, took a bit longer than I expected but I think that the command "feels" 9 billion% better without the all keyword needed.
- Bounties will now show the total worth of a player when they are created.
- Able to use bounty commands from console now. Console is all-powerful, can put bounties on anything, has infinite money, can destroy the universe, etc. etc. ALL HAIL!
- All money is formatted properly now.
- Tax percent is now displayed in /bounty.
- Upgraded logging for money transactions to now be in a seperate file upon request of Chalkie. I think it looks good too.
- Heavily modified the list command some more so that now it displays better. The colors are good, and it always shows up to 15 (skips numbers). Way better looking and usable now.
- Fixed critical issue where bounties actually weren't refunding. (should have been fixed in past, my bad. (reason I took down 3.0)
- Removing bounties not on you using admin or higher permissions will refund the money to the proper person rather than to you. (reason I took down 3.0)

Version 2.31:

* By popular request, added in new bounty tax percent. Sorry it took so long, literally took like 20 seconds to code. xD

Version 2.3:

* Compiled on Dev Build #2368 1.3.2-R0.2
* Ignore worlds also disables anti-spawncamp protection now.
* Player files are in their own seperate folder in the FC_Bounties folder now. No longer merged into FC_Suite_Shared.
* Fixed major bug causing LOT of economies to not function properly due to incorrect Vault API method use. Thank you AndrewKM for the report.
* Upgrade to structure of download. Now includes a README with a few installation instructions, and my information. As well, no longer is the source included. Feel free to use the GITHUB to see the source (included in README).

Version 2.27:

* Fixed a small spot where the new bounty base wasn't being used.
* Fixed ignore worlds not being checked for server bounty random target generation.
* Fixed /bounty admin generate random not picking properly.
* Reimplemented server bounty target name. Somehow was removed from code.
* Added a new message whenever a bounty gets dropped from a player for a reason.
* Updated a lot of chat strings to be more accurate. I realize a lot were older and I could make them more helpful so yeah.
* Removed blockCommands option and just made it so that if blockedCommandCost is greater than 0, then it will be enabled.
* Made it so that killing people set the last killed person to the person killed rather than the killer, small error.
* Bounty drop now informs you of time before you can drop if there is a time before you can drop.
* Restructed help a bit. Added /bounty admin sb. Made help 2 pages now, with /bounty admin being the help for bounties help. Updated help overall.

Version 2.26:

* Fixed color strong for bounty kills as mentioned in video.
* Removed all world guard code from my plugin. HERP DERP. Now the pvp blocking just sets the event being cancelled to false, at high priority. It's really a much more simple solution and works way better than the old method.
* Fixed up the spawn camping code. It wasn't working before, along with the WG bypassing. So they are both fixed now.
* Probably other stuff fixed, doubtful though this time! Pretty small update, but took forever to fix those 2 fixes out... grr

Version 2.25:

* Compiled on 1.3.1. 1.3.2 coming soon. Version is 2.25 due to the several internal versions I used.
* Admins can always drop server bounties no matter what.
* New option to override the exemption node whenever you want. (Just so you can make switching to forced and not forced easier).
* Updated a few messages and text strings to be more appropriate.
* Server bounties automatically drop from a player whenever there aren't enough players online. New config option for this.
* Can have server bounties ignore players in certain worlds.
* Can have server bounties AUTOMATICALLY DROP from players whenever they are in a certain world.
* New admin command for this also.
* New configuration option for this also (defaults to "Creative", add as many as you want).
* Renamed toggleOnOff to just toggle for ease of use.
* Fixed a lot of admin commands not being usable simply due to bad brackets.
* Server bounty generation fixed. I had a bad algorithm, complete recoded it.
* If 1 player is on, then the 'last bounty name' variable will be ignored (prevents bounties on the same person twice in a row). Mostly Quality of Life.
* Added the server bounty base generated amount. Somehow this was lost, don't really know how, but it's on now.
* Optional new tier base bonuses config setting which can be used as a flat amount to increase bounties per interval.
* Updated a lot of the color codes so they are integrated better with FC_Shared_Suite color scheme.
* Updated the help a lot to be way more useful.

Version 2.1.1:

* Updated some issues with player data saving.
* Arrows can now earn you bounties when you use them to kill somebody with them.

Version 2.1:

* Compiled on RB 1.3.1.
* Completely reworked permissions.
* Renamed FC_General to FC_Suite_Shared.
* Player information will now automatically migrate the plugin folder for FC_Suite_Shared. You MUST make a backup of your bans before running this update because they MAY NOT TRANSFER PROPERLY! I do not give my guarantee this migration will work but it worked perfectly for me every time I tested it. If player data doesn't migrate for you to the new folder, then send me a copy of your config and I'll attempt to do the migration for you (and fix any issues there may be). If you didn't make a backup and experience issues, there is no way I can help you. You are warned.

v2.0.1:

Simply compiled against the new dev build of Bukkit. There might be some features that were added, but they were done during private use as bugfixes so I don't have them logged.

v2.0:

- Total rewrite of almost all code. Algorithms are about the same as before. FC_General heavily integrated. Lots of general updates to usability. To make changes to configs, YOU MUST do them with the server down. Plugin was tested solo by myself, could be buggy. Leaderboards may or may not work. I never had anybody to test with. I will be working on player simulation so I don't need others to test this plugin in the future. I will be moniterering this thread actively for bugs as reported.

v1.17:
* Updated to 1.2.5-R4.0
* ALL permission plugins supported by vault now working. GM should work too. Some "may" not work, doubtful, but if people are having issues with any plugin tell me and I will add a soft depend for it to fix the issue.
* Colors changed a bit to a better gray/green. instead of that bold red.
* Bug fixed issues with non-player entities causing players to get kills for bounties. Should prevent weird behavior with tnt getting players kills or mobs.
* Fixed bounty on/off/toggle to actually let you use on/off now.
* Updated all permission nodes and changed them all majorly. Please update permissions files accordingly. Check the front page for the new permissions.
* Removed a few outdated configuration settings (candrop, canexempt) as they are included in the permissions or (startuptries) outdated.
* Option to display bounties when created, which will additionally show when they are removed.
* Command blocker wasn't included??? I guess... somehow it got unincluded. Well it's back in this version. Disable it with the config option if you want
* WG is automatically detected and settings adapt accordingly.

Upcoming Features:
* Items aren't in this version, I am still undecided on whether I will add them or not. Vault will always be a requirement due to permissions, unless you want everybody able to use the admin command... in which case you are probably so small of a representative it's just not worth the effort on my part. But yeah Vault is probably always going to be needed and I just will consider doing them in the next version.
* I know the /top command doesn't work well. I need to develop a leaderboard algorithm. Ugh, I hate going on pen-paper, but I really will have to this next time around. :P

v1.16:

* Vault Support for permissions. No longer need PEX.
* Config should update to 1.16

v1.15:

* Fixed missing null check spamming console every time somebody dies.
* Config version should update to 1.15.

v1.14
* Added percent options if wanted through config options, check config section.
* Made a lot of stuff case non-sensitive now, especially names.
* Fixed the bounties not giving money? I don't know how the plugin is working for people I can't get it to work on my server. I had to completely rewrite a ton of code. O.o.
* Fixed null showing up on bounty creates
* Fixed refunds giving the bounty number rather than the bounties reward upon removing them.
* Fixed overlapping survial and kill bonuses
* Fixed double messages on bounty kills
* The bounty bonuses were ONLY supposed to be on server bounties. This was a mistake on my part, fixed it. It's technically an infinite money exploit if players can make bounties, kill another player, and get a profit out of thin air.
* Can now spend ALL of your money (before you had to save $1) on creating a bounty.
* Tons of little spelling fixes
* Few other bug fixes probably. Can never always remember. Haha.

1.13:
* Fixed a few bugs mentioned in comments. Shows proper money amount now.
* Using try catches on a lot of stuff.
* Op permission will let you use the bounty commands now by default if you don't have the user permission.
* Configuration will update to 3.0 now.
* No longer infinitely initializes the plugin.
* Updated for R3.0

1.12:

* Fixed "World Guard no bounty reward" if the pvp flag is enabled.
* Added more "PEX"-based checks for permission handling to make sure that you really need PEX and that things shouldn't glitch.
* Configs no longer reset on restarts if you make changes to them.

1.11:

* Will be TRYING to make sure that there is no need to ever delete configs again. Delete your configs one time for good measure on this one, but I'll be actively trying to make sure there is no need to delete them after this update. I can't guarantee you "won't" have to delete them due to bugs so in the future I recommend making backups before updating, at least until I am 100% positive configs won't break.
* Added the ability to disable the command blocking. Also added configuration file help on the front page as requested.
* You need FC_Bounty.user to have the plugin work for users: /bounty command. I fixed it, it was FC_Bounties.user before.

1.1:

* Lots of good fixes for a bunch of random stuff. Had a good chance to test out the plugin and a lot of features. The leader board SHOULD work, but I honestly have no idea if it works for 5 people. I will hopefully know soon but for now it may/may not work.
* Instant server bounties after a kill
* Server bounty will not repeat to the same player that just used /bounty drop.
* Few more configuration options
* Removed tag options in config. Default color scheme is best really...
* Lots of small fixes and such everywhere. Generally everything should work better now.

1.0: Works fine now. Got leader-boards working. :D Compiled with the 1.2.4 dev version as well.

0.8: First beta release. Only problem is the leader-boards, trying to create a more efficient way of doing this as well as get it to work, everything else works though. Still needs a lot of testing with all of the configuration values that I added. They "should" work, but testing usually shows that not everything goes as planned. Works with all versions, just isn't compiled with latest dev build yet.
