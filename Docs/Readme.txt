Description:
FC_Bounties is a plugin that brings together traditional player created bounties with generated bounty events. Player bounties are bounties placed on other players by players while server bounties are randomly generated bounties placed on random players! FC_Bounties has an emphasis on customization, which is why there are currently 45+ configuration settings for bounty settings. WOW! Customize bounty creation taxes, cash steal, money loss, exact cash values for server bounties and TONS more to have bounties work exactly as you want. As well, all of this power is highly optimized with all information about bounties and player settings being stored directly to configuration files to prevent any data loss ever, unless of course your files are deleted. With FC_Bounties, it's time to spice your server up a lot!
